x = 1
x = 1.1

print(10 + 3)
print(10 - 3)
print(10 * 3)
print(10 / 3)  # This will return the float 3.3333
print(10 // 3)  # This will return an integer, so 3
print(10 % 3)  # This will return the remainder of the division calculation
print(10 ** 3)  # This will take 10 to the power of 3

x = 10
x = x + 3  #This statement
x += 3  # Is the same as this statement, the both increment x by 3, can use any of the math operators this way as well
